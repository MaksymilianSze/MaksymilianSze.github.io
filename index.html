                <p>I am currently completing my first year of Computer Science degree at City. Prior to the start of my course I have had experience in Python
                    when doing my GCSE's and A Level's. In my spare time I enjoy playing video games.

                <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Mandelbrot Set</h3>
                <p>
                    My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at
                    City (2020). This processing project uses the the understanding of iteration and selection, as well as, some maths compenents such as
                    imaginary numbers, complex numbers, diverging and converging numbers. By iterating the equation f(z)=z^2+c and colouring a pixel based on
                    whether the result tends to infinity I created a nice looking fractal. I also created a zoom feature so you can look at the patterns that
                    get smaller and smaller in an interactive way using the mouse. I used floating point numbers to store my values for my project and one limitation of this is that
                    when you zoom in large amounts into the fractal you start to see the inaccuracies (it gets blurry and pixelated)as the number get smaller and smaller.

                <h3>Computer Science Year 1 Java Project: Monster Trucker</h3>
                <p>
                    For my first Java programming project I created a 2D monster truck game using the JBox2D physics engine. It's a plaforming game with the objective of reaching the end flag while collecting coins along the way. During this project I have learnt a lot about object oriented programming. SOme of the struggles I faced during this project was maintaining encapsulation and using java collections.

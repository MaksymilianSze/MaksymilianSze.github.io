      <p> Add some information about yourself. For now we're happy to know anything you're
      willing to share about yourself (though one thing we are curious about is your programming
      experience before bootcamp). As your progress through your degree at City you will 
      be able to add more here (e.g., interests, skills, experience, a link to a CV). However,
      even then, it's better to keep this information concise (about a paragraph or two)
      and let your CV and the projects below to do the rest of the talking.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Forest scene</h3>
    <p>
      My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
      City (2020). This processing project uses the the understanding of iteration and selection, as well as, some maths compenents such as 
      imaginary numbers, complex numbers, diverging and converging numbers. By iterating the equation f(z)=z^2+c and colouring a pixel based on 
      whether the result tends to infinity I created a nice looking fractal. I also created a zoom feature so you can look at the patterns that 
      get smaller and smaller in an interactive way using the mouse.
